# Journey-Through-Memories
Journey Through Memories is a 2D adventure game set in the aftermath of war, that utilizes speech recognition. The player uses their voice to move and cast spells as the witch, Vivi, to uncover the untold past as you journey through the memories of the fallen victims of war.
